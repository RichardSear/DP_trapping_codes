## Figure codes for DP trapping manuscript and supplemental
#### 

### Summary

The code implements the rejection sampling with memory (RSwM3)
adaptive time step Brownian dynamics (BD) algorithm ('ALGORITHM 2') from 
[Sammüller and Schmidt, J. Chem. Phys. 155, 134107 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0062396), 
using embedded Heun–Euler trial steps.  The implementation is for
Brownian motion of a single particle in three dimensions, and is
intended to be partly pedagogical, as well as providing a code
repository for some simulations related to particle trapping by
diffusiophoresis (DP).
