## Figure codes for DP trapping manuscript and supplemental

Working repository for codes to produce figures for manuscript on
diffusiophoretic (DP) trapping of colloids and macromolecules (eg DNA)
by injected salt solutions.

Some codes simply plot flow fields or drift fields, others analyse
Brownian dynamics simulation data generated by the sister project
implementing an adaptive time step Brownian dynamics code, at  
https://github.com/patrickbwarren/python3-adaptive-BD

* Fig 1: Schematic of pipette flow field and salt concentration
* Fig 2: Pipette drift field and fixed points for two Q values


To make the figures, do something like
```
make DEST_DIR=..
```
where the destination directory is where the figure files end up, here
in the next level up
